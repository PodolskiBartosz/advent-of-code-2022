# Day 7: No Space Left On Device (https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7)
# Conditions:
# - The input represents commandos and outputs in a windows scheme, which are seperated by line
# - Available commandos are "cd" and "ls" and start with "$"
# - Outputs list directories and files; Output of a directory starts with "dir" and then name of the directory;
#   Output of a file starts with the size of a file and then the name
# - The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains directly or indirectly
