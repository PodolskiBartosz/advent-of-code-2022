## Advent of Code - 2022

### Description
My solutions to the **Advent of Code** challenges written in Python. 
My focus was on writing an efficient and pretty concise but understandable solution with some amount of 
explanation in the form of comments. 

This project serves as a way to brush up on my python skills and knowledge.
